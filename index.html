        <b>We moved to Fairbanks Alaska when I was 1 year old and lived there \n 
            until I was 16. We moved back to Utah and I lived with my older sister\n 
            in Kearns, and then a friend in Albequerque and then I moved back to Kaysville, \n 
            when I turned 18 I moved out on my own and moved around a bit until I settled \n 
            in Layton where I live now.</b>
