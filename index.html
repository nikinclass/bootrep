            <b>I would like to drive around the coast in Boston, <br>

            <span>Boston looks like a great place to visit, <br> 
                I would like to drive around the coast and<br> 
                walk on the boardwalks and eat fresh oysters <br>
                and clam chowder, and have a lobster roll, <br>
                and walk through the city and maybe go see a baseball game</span>

                 and go on a ghost tour.</span>
            <li>New Orleans</li>
            <span>New Orleans is so rich in culture and food I would like<br>
                to walk down Bourbon street and check out all of the bars and 
                restaurants, listen to music and eat begnets.</span>
